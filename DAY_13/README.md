# ðŸŽ¤ AI Voice Agent

Welcome to the **AI Voice Agent** project!  
This is an interactive voice chatbot powered by Google's Gemini LLM, built using Python and Streamlit. Users can converse with the AI by speaking directly into their microphones, and receive both text and spoken replies.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: UI framework for interactive web apps.
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**: LLM for intelligent responses.
- **SpeechRecognition**: Converts speech input to text.
- **pyttsx3**: Text-to-speech for AI replies.
- **dotenv**: Secure environment variable handling.
- **threading**: Non-blocking audio playback.

## Architecture

- **Streamlit Frontend**: Displays UI, captures user actions.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Listens to microphone input, transcribes to text.
- **LLM (Gemini API)**: Processes chat history, generates responses.
- **Text-to-Speech**: AI replies are played aloud using pyttsx3.
- **Session Management**: Maintains conversation history.
